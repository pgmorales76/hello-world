# hello-world

Hello all!!!

My name is Peter. I just began learning GitHub.
The reason for this is because I am starting on a new career path to become a software engineer.
My background is in the electrical trade, working as an apprentice electrician.
I'm changing career paths because I've become fascinated by software engineering,
and I believe my future will be more secure as a software engineer versus an electrician.
I am doing this with no experience, whatsoever.
I would appreciate any, constructive, criticism.
Thanks, in advance, for your help!
Be well!
